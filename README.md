### Create a Production Tracking System

We already have this system and would like you to recreate it.

## Job Creation Form:

In this form or page, we should be able to _enter_ information in to the following fields

- Order number
- SKU
- Number of items
- Number of stones
- Job description
- Setter name (Setter A, Setter B, Setter C)

Please note that **time** is very valuable for us, therefore in our current system we do not close the form instead we clear the fields after every submission. This way we do not need to keep re-opening the form for every job entry.

## Jobs Page:

This page should show the entries of jobs with the following columns:

- Order number
- SKU
- Number of items
- Number of stones
- Job description
- Setter name (Setter A, Setter B, Setter C)
- Name of the person created the job (Person A, Person B, Person C)
- Job creation date
- Name of the person assigned the jobs and printed the memo
- Memo number

## Filtering

We shall be able to _filter_ on this result page by the the following fields at minimum, _it would be better if we can filter on all fields_

- Order number
- SKU
- Setter name (the most important field we need to be able to filter on)
- Job creation date

Once we filter and get the expected results, then we shall be able to choose **multiple rows** or **all the rows** AND **assign to a setter** (Setter A, Setter B, Setter C) to create a memo.

- We need to calculate the Total Amount by multiplying the total number of stones by $0.50. What would be the amount we need to pay to the setter.

- This memo should be in printable format, and we shold be able to pull previous memos and reprint when needed.

Below you can see the screenshots from each page to give you the idea, and you free not to design and develop in exact same way.

Please note: You will be seeing additional fields from our current system however
